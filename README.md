**Machine Learning Model**

This project is an end-to-end automated machine learning application that enables users to train, evaluate, and save ML classification models through an interactive Streamlit web interface. The system abstracts complex ML steps such as preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation, making it suitable for both beginners and practitioners.

**Features**

- Interactive web-based UI using Streamlit
- Automated data preprocessing (missing values, scaling, encoding)
- Support for multiple ML classification algorithms
- Real-time model training and evaluation
- Model persistence using Pickle for reuse

**Technologies Used**
- Python
- Streamlit
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost
- Pandas & NumPy
- Pickle
